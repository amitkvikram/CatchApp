This app is associated with the Gogo app. This app is for the drivers to pick the pessengers on their request on particular
bus stops.
Whenever the passenger sends a "pick me" request (in Gogo App), the location of the bus stop nearest to the location of the 
passenger appears as a marker on the map of Catch App.
We are using Firebase real-time cloud database and firebase authentification for the user login.
